# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

In this project, we are to transform an already styled webpage, using flexbox, to achieve the results shown in the image shown above.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without any help, these basic concepts;

- Fexbox
- Converting float positions to flex display
- The difference between the main and cross axes, and aligning elements horizontally and vertically using flexbox
- Flex containers vs flex items/elements
- Shorthand for flex
- And, how to create a new page with flex in mind

# TASKS

The following tasks are to be completed by following the step-by-step instructions fromt he following tasks on the intranet. Keeping in mind the already designed webpaged above, and the provided HTML and CSS starter files, we are to ;

1. Add the flex display(4pts)
2. Add new classes to sections(6pts)
3. Reverse the order of the latest news cards(3pts)
4. Simplify the service list(3pts)
5. Experiment with the spacing between flex service items(5pts)
6. Apply flex to the header(11pts)
7. Apply flex to the navigation bar(6pts). And last, but not least;
8. Align the logo and navigation bar to the center(1pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Unlike the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, SO once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.
