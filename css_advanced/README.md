**CSS, ADVANCED (PROJECT 11 | WEEK 04)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

In this project, we will apply the knowledge we've acquired so far to a practical project. All previous project resources are available for review, if need be. We are also at liberty to do our personal research and are not limited to the resources provided for this project by ALX.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without any help, these basic concepts;

- CSS
- Adding style to any element
- Classes, selectors, and box properties
- COmputing CSS Specificity Values
- How a browser loads a webpage

# TASKS

The following tasks are to be completed with the help of the wireframe and design file provided through Figma(attached at the end of this document with other resources). The flow of tasks for this project are as follows;

1. Create an amazing README file(which we are currently on)(3pts)
2. Import a CSS stylesheet(1pt)
3. Work ont he header and banner(10pts)
4. Add quotes(5pts)
5. Work on the video lists(9pts)
6. Complete the membership section(6pts)
7. Complete the FAQ column(5pts). And last, but not least;
8. Finish the footer section(6pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
