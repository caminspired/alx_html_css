**HTML FORMS (PROJECT 32 | WEEK 15)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be creating forms using HTML.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand what HTML forms are, see some examples of HTML form elements and their attributes (eg: input, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc). We will also learn how to implement basic form validation using HTML5 attributes, such as required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, and more.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Simple Contact Form(7pts)
1. Registration Form(7pts)
2. Subscription Form with Radio Buttons(8pts)
3. Feedback Form with Checkboxes and File Upload(8pts)
4. Survey Form with Select Dropdown, Time, and Date Selection(11pts)

# REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.

# CONCLUSION
